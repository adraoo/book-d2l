# Rules

- Do not remove any comment, unless they become false or deprecated, or when the user explicitly requests it
- if you add some comment, make it short
- if you add some comment, always add them in english, including in migrations and prisma schema
- whenever you create a file, add as a header some documentation in english to explain its goal
